# ChauffeurNet
reproduction the result according to this paper[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03079.pdf].
I just implement it on the basis of my comprehensionï¼Œbecause the paper didn't introduce the neural network in every detail.
the model is implemented by Keras with Tensorflow backend.

Roadmap:
1.Model and train and prediction with mocked data.
2.Data pipeline for real data.
3.Train it in real world data.
4.Other approachs in paper.
5.Test it in simulation.
  I want the model can be used in different simulation environment. Welcome other contributors to integrate different open source or private simulators. 
  I will combine my company's simulator and some simple simulators first.
6.Test it in Real world on china's urban road.
